          I am a Systems Engineer with 20 years of professional programming
          experience in web and games. I specialize in building the foundation
          for platforms and teams, robust product designs, and inspiring
          leadership. I love to solve impossible problems. Cutting edge web,
          games, robotic space mining, biotech, microfinance, embedded devices,
          energy hacking, or something entirely new. If they think it can't be
          done, I'll to be the one to do it.

              We had a job working with a AAA-game engine in C++ with a policy
              of not allowing third-party libraries. In order to facilitate
              using Flash as a UI design environment (which is now common with
              AAA games) I wrote a spec-complete ActionScript 2 interpreter with
              enhanced features like thread/process-safe asynchronous updates, a
              fully automated spec test suite self-written in ActionScript, an
              extensive customized game-enhanced UIComponent library for Flash
              artists to rapidly and easily create a game UI for the current and
              future titles, and more.

            <p class="text-sm leading-6">
              We wanted to make a Facebook game look more awesome than anyone
              had ever seen, and make it look like it was a real 3D rendered
              isometric engine. In order to accomodate the requirements of high
              resolution sprites with many more frames of animation than a
              typical Flash game, I came up with an advanced asset manager that
              intelligently predicted texture usage for pre-caching and
              unloading behind the scenes in partial real-time. To render it, I
              created an accompanying asset buffering and rendering pipeline
              that optimized around the limitations of the Flash renderer. The
              result was an incredibly fancy looking Flash game that allowed
              artists to maximize their art talents while the asset manager,
              renderer and pre-compiler worried about optimization.

              &ldquo;Brian displayed a great aptitude both for solving complex
              technical problems and explaining relevant details of his
              solutions in a clear and concise manner. Brian kept the project on
              track without making his team members feel micromanaged, fostering
              creativity and encouraging everyone to provide input for important
              decisions. Furthermore, Brian took any available opportunity to
              help members of his team learn new skills that they could apply to
              the project, and I found his guidance invaluable on many
              occasions. Regardless of the situation, Brian was always open,
              approachable, and eager to do whatever he could to ensure the
              completion of tasks, making it easy to hash out development issues
              whenever the need arose. Working with Brian was a very rewarding
              experience and I would be happy to have the opportunity to do so
              again.&rdquo;
