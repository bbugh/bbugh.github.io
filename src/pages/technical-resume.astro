            2D/3D visual math, particularly geometry. Despite my strong math

              get the job done. He also has a very forward thinking approach and
              was able to predict and avoid many pitfalls.&rdquo;

              &ldquo;It's not only a personal pleasure to work with Brian, but
              he's also a superb software engineer and natural team leader.
              Brian is able to very effectively look ahead and foresee
              development issues long before they were apparent and would always
              lead the charge from the front. Brian has an excellent work ethic
              and invests himself in his work like few others I've known. For
              this reason I consider Brian to be one of the best team leaders
              I've worked with and I look forward to working with Brian again.
              He comes with my absolute highest recommendations.&rdquo;

              &ldquo;I had the pleasure of working on a team led by Brian at Pi
              Studios. Brian displayed a great aptitude both for solving complex
              technical problems and explaining relevant details of his
              solutions in a clear and concise manner. Brian kept the project on
              track without making his team members feel micromanaged, fostering
              creativity and encouraging everyone to provide input for important
              decisions. Furthermore, Brian took any available opportunity to
              help members of his team learn new skills that they could apply to
              the project, and I found his guidance invaluable on many
              occasions. Regardless of the situation, Brian was always open,
              approachable, and eager to do whatever he could to ensure the
              completion of tasks, making it easy to hash out development issues
              whenever the need arose. Working with Brian was a very rewarding
              experience and I would be happy to have the opportunity to do so
              again.&rdquo;
