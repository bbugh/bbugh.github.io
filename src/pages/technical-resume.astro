              smooth crossfading, pausing, and more.

              A large bank client had recently developed an internal
              administration system that was built by a third party that was
              buggy, insecure, difficult to use—and worst of all—very, very
              slow. It took the previous contractor team six months to build
              (based on a one month estimate) and was horribly insecure (SQL
              injection, client-only password validation, etc.). At the client's
              request, I completely rewrote the entire system from the ground up
              in ASP.net, which I had never used before, in a way that was very
              fast, secure, and easy to use—in two weeks.

              I created a file packaging system that featured intelligent file
              data distribution, strong security, and custom compression that
              minimized file size and reduced game load times from ~45 seconds
              to &lt; 8 seconds while also greatly reducing the chance of
              hacking.

              scriptable by non-programmers), cross-platform asset packaging and

              We had a job working with a AAA-game engine in C++ with a policy
              of not allowing third-party libraries. In order to facilitate
              using Flash as a UI design environment (which is now common with
              AAA games) I wrote a spec-complete ActionScript 2 interpreter with
              enhanced features like thread/process-safe asynchronous updates, a
              fully automated spec test suite self-written in ActionScript, an
              extensive customized game-enhanced UIComponent library for Flash
              artists to rapidly and easily create a game UI for the current and

              The project goal was to make a Facebook game look more awesome
              than anyone had ever seen, and make it look like it was a real 3D
              rendered isometric engine. In order to accomodate the requirements
              of high resolution sprites with many more frames of animation than
              a typical Flash game, I came up with an advanced asset manager
              that intelligently predicted texture usage for pre-caching and
              unloading behind the scenes in partial real-time. To render it, I
              created an accompanying asset buffering and rendering pipeline
              that optimized around the limitations of the Flash renderer. The
              result was an incredibly fancy looking Flash game that allowed
              artists to maximize their art talents while the asset manager,
              renderer and pre-compiler worried about optimization.

              2D/3D visual math, particularly geometry. Despite my strong math
              skills in other areas and extensive tutoring by team members I
              have never clicked with spatial math. Thankfully most modern tools
              handle this for us.

              Working with low-experienced developers on a production team: a
              previous manager said that I am excellent at taking the 80-100%
              and getting 150% out of them, but not great at reaching below that
              80% to bring them up. I work best with other experienced
              developers. However, I love teaching students who are new to
              development.

            <li>
              I can organize myself, and I can create plans for teams, but I
              cannot organize teams well. I am not a project manager and I do
              not do well keeping track of all minor details of the moving
              pieces of a large project. I work eceptionally well when paired
              with a strong project manager who can handle the logistics of
              keeping the day-to-day details straight, while I focus on the
              technical strategy, architecture, and team leadership.
            </li>
            <li>
              Getting the best work out of me involves putting me ahead of
              others on projects doing the foundation, predictive
              problem-solving, and pioneering work. I can definitely do
              maintenance work and long-tail end of project bug fixing, but my
              strongest gifts lie in the pre-planning and early implementation
              phases of projects where I can scaffold the best path forward for
              others to follow.
